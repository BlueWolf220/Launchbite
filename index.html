  <h2 style='color:blue'> What is launchbite? </h2>
  <p1 style='color:white'>
    Launchbite is a python-powered app. all you have to do is press a button, and the app you want pops up.<br/>
    This is good if you want to have your toolbar hidden, and don't want to deal with shortcuts.<br/>
  </p1>
  <h2 style='color:blue'> How does it work? </h2>
  <p1 style='color:white'>
    Well, Launchbite uses the Tkinter and keyboard modules.<br/>
    The Tkinter library creates the buttons. When the buttons get presses, it triggers the keyboard to press and release the windows key and a number.<br/>
    Heads up, your applications must be in a certain spot for the code to function. Possibly in later versions, other means will be used.<br/>
    The code is not perfect, and will no doubt be updated.<br/>
