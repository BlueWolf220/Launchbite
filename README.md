# Launchbite
 A simple app to open apps, like Fusion360 and Mu, and is easily customizable. It is written in pure python.

 All you need to learn to customize this app is minor Tkinter, and the keyboard module.
I decided to use the logos of the apps, but only to make customization easier. This desktop is only compatible with windows, and is filled with apps I open most often.

The app requires a little bit of setup, but it is just putting apps on the toolbar. from left to right the apps go: files, mail, Fusion 360, Eagle, chrome, GitKraken, GitHub desktop, atom, and mu.
